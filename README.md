# CookiesConsent for Android

Android library to show a dialog informing of the use of cookies to the users on the EU.

![Screenshot of the dialog](screenshot.png)

## Setup

Just add the dependency to your *gradle.build*
```groovy
compile 'com.github.carlosph:cookiesconsent:0.9'
```

## Usage

Simply create a new ```CookiesConsetDialog``` and call it's method ```showIfApplies()```.

To add a link to your privacy policy use the method ```setPolicyUrl(String policyUrl)```, and to set it as cancelable you can use ```setCancelable(boolean cancelable)```.

As an example, adding this line to the **onCreate** method of your **MainActivity** will show the dialog the firs time an user on the EU opens the app.
```java
new CookiesConsentDialog(this).setPolicyUrl("https://github.com/Carlosph/CookiesConsent").showIfApplies();
```

## Thanks

The code to detect if the user is from the European Union is from this [Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31739347/android-eu-cookie-law), asked by [Mr.Betatester](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2235837/mr-betatester) and answered by [Ruyo](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5240952/ruyo).
