# CookiesConsent for Android

Android library to inform EU users of the use of cookies. The alert can be shown via dialog or an overlay view.

## Setup

Just add the dependency to your *gradle.build*
```groovy
compile 'com.github.carlosph:cookiesconsent:0.9.2'
```

## Usage

Simply create a new ```CookiesConsetDialog``` or ```CookiesConsetOverlay``` and call the method ```showIfApplies```.

To add a link to your privacy policy use the method ```setPolicyUrl(String policyUrl)```.

You only need to add one line to the **onCreate** method of your **MainActivity** to show the dialog or overlay to EU users when they open the app for the first time.

```java
new CookiesConsentDialog(this)
    .setPolicyUrl("https://github.com/Carlosph/CookiesConsent")
    .showIfApplies();
```

```java
new CookiesConsentOverlay(this)
    .setPolicyUrl("https://github.com/Carlosph/CookiesConsent")
    .showIfApplies();
```

There are just a few strings to be translated, so if your language is not supported, please help us by sending the translation.

You can send a pull request or just send me the strings, as you like. I will try to keep the library updated with the translations that I receive.

The code to detect if the user is from the European Union is from this [Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31739347/android-eu-cookie-law), asked by [Mr.Betatester](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2235837/mr-betatester) and answered by [Ruyo](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5240952/ruyo).
