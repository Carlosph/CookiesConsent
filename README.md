# CookiesConsent for Android

Android library to inform EU users of the use of cookies. The alert can be shown via dialog or an overlay view.

## Gradle

Add the next dependency to your *gradle.build*
```groovy
compile 'com.github.carlosph:cookiesconsent:0.9.4'
```

## Usage

On the **onCreate** method of your **MainActivity**, create a new ```CookiesConsetDialog``` or ```CookiesConsetOverlay``` and call the method ```showIfApplies()```.

To add a link to your privacy policy use the method ```setPolicyUrl(String policyUrl)```.

If you need to run some code only when the user has given the consent (i.e. ads or analytics code), you can set a ```CookiesConsentListener```, and the code on its ```onCookiesAllowed``` method will be executed only when the user is not from the EU or he has already being notified about the use of cookies.

Additionally you can use the method ```CookiesConsentAlert.isConsentNeeded(Context context)```  anywhere in your code to know if the user has yet to give consent about the use of cookies.

#Example

To show the dialog or the overlay to EU users when they open the app for the first time just add the following code:

**Dialog**
```java
new CookiesConsentDialog(this)
	.setPolicyUrl("https://github.com/Carlosph/CookiesConsent")
	.showIfApplies();
```

**Overlay**
```java
new CookiesConsentOverlay(this)
	.setPolicyUrl("https://github.com/Carlosph/CookiesConsent")
	.showIfApplies();
```

**With listener**

If you want to run some code only when users are not from EU or when they have already given consent to the use of cookies, you can use a listener. The code would be something like this:
```java
new CookiesConsentOverlay(this)
    .setPolicyUrl("https://github.com/Carlosph/CookiesConsent")
    .setListener(new CookiesConsentAlert.CookiesConsentListener() {
        @Override
        public void onCookiesAllowed() {
			// Code for non EU users or users
			// which have already given consent
        }
    })
    .showIfApplies();
```

The code to detect if the user is from the European Union is from this [Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31739347/android-eu-cookie-law), asked by [Mr.Betatester](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2235837/mr-betatester) and answered by [Ruyo](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5240952/ruyo).
